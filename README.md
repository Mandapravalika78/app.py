# project title :AI/ML-Based Environmental Change Detection Using Satellite Derived NDVI

In recent years, environmental degradation caused by deforestation, rapid urbanization, and climate change has emerged as a critical global concern. These processes have led to significant loss of biodiversity, disruptions in ecosystem services, and worsening climate impacts. Monitoring these environmental changes is essential for informed decision-making and effective policy implementation.

However, traditional ground-based monitoring methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, costly, and limited in geographic scope. To address these limitations, this project proposes a satellite-based approach to monitor and detect environmental changes—specifically focusing on vegetation health—using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery.

NDVI is a widely used remote sensing index that provides a reliable measure of vegetation health and density by analyzing the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs). By leveraging NDVI data from satellites, it is possible to efficiently monitor large areas over time, detect early signs of environmental degradation, and 
support conservation and land management efforts.
